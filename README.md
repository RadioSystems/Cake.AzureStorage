## Functionality

Supports uploading Blobs to Azure Blob Storage as well as deleting them by prefix and by name. More features to be added in the future.

## Usage

To use the addin just add it to Cake call the aliases and configure any settings you want.

```csharp
#addin "Cake.AzureStorage"
...

// How to package with no settings
Task("PackageNoSettings")
	.Does(() => {
     var settings = new AzureStorageSettings();
     settings.AccountName = "AccountName";
     settings.Key = "API KEY";
     settings.ContainerName = "ContainerName";
     settings.BlobName = "BlobName";
	   UploadFileToBlob(settings, GetFile("./path/to/file/to/upload"));
	});


Task("PackageAfterDelete")
	.Does(() => {
		var settings = new AzureStorageSettings();
		settings.AccountName = "AccountName";
		settings.Key = "API KEY";
		settings.ContainerName = "ContainerName";
		settings.BlobName = "NameToDelete";
		DeleteBlob(settings);
	
		settings.BlobName = "NameToUploadAs";
		var filePath = new FilePath("./location/of/file/to/upload");
		UploadFileToBlob(settings, filePath);
	});

Task("PackageAfterMultiDelete")
	.Does(() => {
		var settings = new AzureStorageSettings();
		settings.AccountName = "AccountName";
		settings.Key = "API KEY";
		settings.ContainerName = "ContainerName";
		settings.BlobName = "PrefixToSearchBy";
		
		var deletedLog = DeleteBlobsByPrefix(settings);
		foreach (var line in deletedLog){
			Information(line);
		}
		
		settings.BlobName = "NameToUploadAs";
		var filePath = new FilePath("./location/of/file/to/upload");
		UploadFileToBlob(settings, filePath);
	});
```

The Prefix used for deleting blobs is exactly like it sounds, a prefix of the file you want to delete. So if you have files named ABC-ImportantFile-1.0.0.1.exe, ABC-ImportantFile-1.0.0.2.exe, ABC-ImportantFile-1.0.0.3.exe, etc. You can delete these by specifying "ABC-ImportantFile-" as your blob name and it will get all files starting with that string. 

That's it.

Hope you enjoy using.
